MODULE EIGHT

STRINGS
- In Java, a String is a sequence of characters.  Unlike “int” or “double”, String is an object (that’s why its capitalized).  

CONCATENATION: String a = “A”;
String b = “B”;
String ab = a+b; // “AB”

SUBSTRINGS
String cs = “computer science”
cs.substring(0,1) → “c”
cs.substring(1,4) → “omp”

REPLACE
cs.replace(“c”,”k”) → komputer skienke

CHALLENGE: 
ACSL CODING QUESTION FROM 2006-2007: 

PROBLEM: The Swedish Chef is a character from the Muppet Show.  He spoke in his one language.  The language is a combination of English, mock-Swedish and nonsense.  Your task is to create an English to Chef translator.  The language rules in priority order are as follows:
1. All sentences end with "Bork Bork Bork!"
2. Replace all occurrences of "THE" with "ZEE"
3. Replace all occurrences of "AN" with "UN"
4. Replace all occurrences of "AU" with "OO"
5. Replace all occurrences of "A" not at the end of a word with "E"
6. Replace all occurrences of "OW" with "OO"
7. Replace all occurrences of  "O" with "U"
8. Replace all occurrences of "IR" with "UR"
9. Replace all occurrences of "TION" with "SHUN"
10. Replace all occurrences of "E" at the end of a word with "E-A"
11. Replace the first occurrence of "I" in a word other than at the start of the word with "EE".  Note #8 and #9 are done first. 

INPUT: There will be 5 input lines.  Each line will contain a string representing a sentence
