MODULE THREE: 
INTEGERS
First, let’s learn how to add or subtract two integers.  Use + for addition and - for subtraction
To add two integers:
int a = 1
int b = 2
int sum = a + b
System.out.println(sum)


CHALLENGE ONE:
Write  a program that subtracts two numbers


Now, let’s add two integers that are entered as command line arguments by a user.  We will have to cast the input arguments to integers using Integer.parseInt(argument)


String name = args[0]
int x = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
int y = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
int sum = x + y;
System.out.println(name + "'s sum is " sum)


DOUBLES:
There are two other important operations of multiplication * and division /. What happens when you compute a / b in the above example? You expect to get an answer of 0.5 but something went wrong. We need a type called double to address this issue, and account for numbers with digits after the decimal point.  


To divide two numbers: 
double a = 1
double b = 2
double quotient = a + b
System.out.println(quotient)


CHALLENGE TWO: 
Read in a name and age in years and write "Hello,  name. You are x  many seconds old"
