MODULE FOUR: BOOLEAN LOGIC
1. Boolean variables (“boolean” in java), are variables that store a value of either 1 or 0, also denoted as True or False
2. Boolean operators: AND, OR, NOT, XOR.  
  1. AND (&&)
  
  2. OR (||)
  
  3. NOT (!)
  
  4. XOR (^)
  
  
CHALLENGE ONE:
1. What is 1 AND 1? (1 && 1) hint, it's not 2!
2. What is 1 AND 0? (1 && 0)
3. What is 1 OR 1? (1 || 1)
4. What is 1 OR 0? (1 || 0)
5. What is 1 XOR 1? (1 ^ 1)
6. What is 1 XOR 0? (1 ^ 0)
7. What is 0 XOR 0? (0 ^ 0)
8. Go back through parts 1-7 and print out the answers to each question using System.out.println.

CHALLENGE TWO: 
1. What is a AND 0? 
2. a AND 1?
3. a OR 0?
4. a OR 1?

CHALLENGE THREE: 
let A be “it is summer”
let B be “it is sunny”
1. Suppose NOT(A) AND NOT(B) is true, then what is also true in terms of AND?
        NOT(A or B) is equivalent to NOT(A) AND NOT(B)
2. Suppose A OR B is true, then what is also true in terms of AND?
                A or B is equivalent to NOT((NOT(A) AND NOT(B))
