MODULE SIX: WHILE LOOPS
While loops have an initial state, a test condition, a body, and an ending state.  Identify each component in the following while loop: 


int counter = 0;
int max = 5
int a = 1;
int b = 5;
while (counter < max){
        System.out.print(a+b + “ ”);
        a = 10 * a;
        b = b+2;
        counter +=1;
}


TRACE: 
1. counter = 0, max = 5, a = 1, b = 5: print 6
2. counter = 1, max = 5, a = 10, b = 7: print 17
3. counter = 2, max = 5, a = 100, b = 9, print 109
4. counter = 3, max = 5, a = 1000, b = 11, print 1011
5. counter = 4, max = 5, a = 10000, b = 13, print 10013
6. counter = 5, max = 5, a = 100000, b = 15.  counter not < max → stop. 


Final output: 6 17 109 1011 10013


VARIATIONS: How does the output change... 
1. if we remove the counter +=1 statement?
2. if we change the counter +=1 statement to counter +=2? to counter +=5?
3. if we change max to 100 and keep all else the same?
4. if we put the print statement at the end of the loop instead of the beginning?

CHALLENGE TWO: FIBONACCI
The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers such that each number, starting at the third number, 
is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.  The first two numbers are 1, 1.  For example, the first 
10 fibonacci numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.  Print out the first 20 fibonacci numbers 
by using a while loop.
