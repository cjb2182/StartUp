MODULE 1: Unix and Vim
1. Open your Desktop in finder so you can see what's going on 
2. Navigate to the Desktop: cd Desktop
3. You will now create and navigate to a series of subdirectories with the following commands: 
   1. mkdir comp_sci
   2. cd comp_sci
   3. mkdir module_one
   4. mkdir module_one
   5. cd module_one
   6. mkdir my_directory
1. Now, type pwd to see your current path directory.  It should say Users/your_username/Desktop/comp_sci/module_one. Why is my_directory not in the current path?
2. Delete the directory: rmdir my_directory
3. Make the directory again: mkdir my_directory
4. Create a file in my_directory with vim.  First, navigate to my_directory: cd my_directory. Then, use vim to create a file: 
   1. vim my_file.txt 
   2. i - to insert text
   3. write: "This is my first file. " 
   4. esc :w enter to save
   5. :q  enter to quit
   6. Note: you can combine w and q by writing :wq enter


CHALLENGE ONE: 
Starting in the module_one directory, without using the cd command, create a file secret_file.txt that contains the text secret file created. Then, make a copy of the file called: secret_file2.txt. What is the full path of both of those files? 
Hint: type man pwd to learn more about the pwd command. Type q to exit the pwd documentation page. 


CHALLENGE TWO: 
move secret_file2.txt to a new subdirectory of my_directory called my_subdirectory. What is the new full path of secret_file2.txt?
Hint: you need to use two commands


CHALLENGE THREE: 
Navigate to the directory my_directory. Make another copy of secret_file.txt and call it revealed_file.txt.  this file should be in your current directory (my_directory).  How can you do this without writing out the full path of the directory you are in? Hint: use the . (period) command to specify current directory


MODULE 1.2: More Vim
Vim is used to both create a file (as you just did), and to edit a file.  


Now we will edit the file my_file.txt with the following command: vim my_file.txt
1. Append the text end to the line using A. Then press esc to get back to reading mode..  Note that A enters editing mode at the end of the line
2. Use I to insert the text start at the beginning of the line. 
Now your file should have the text: start This is my first file. end


CHALLENGE FOUR: 
a and i  work the same as A and I but they enter editing mode at the end and beginning of a word, respectively, rather than at the end and beginning of a line. Use a to change the word file to files and use i to change the word is to tis. Press escape in between a and i commands


CHALLENGE FIVE: 
The x command deletes the character it is hovering over.  Use the x command to delete the word my. You will have to navigate to the word my using the arrows, and then press x two times, once for each letter


CHALLENGE SIX: 
The r command works similarly to x but it replaces one character.  Use r to change the T in This to a lowercase t Save the file using :wq
